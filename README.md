# colour-changing-fire-led-simulation
fire simulation using ws2812 led strips with "flame" colour changing effect is established.

This program is originally taken from https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/Fire2012 page and modified for my project.
I have mainly modified the color scheme in order to get slow and smoothe blending of colour of the fire effect. With properly chosen paramters the effect could appear more dynamic and non-monotoous. 
For the hardware side, I have use a small foam hose (~15cm). The hose was thick so it blended the light evenly in all directions. Even though the number of leds used was only 7, the effect turned out to be quite soothing when parameters were adapted.
Modifying the colour scheme gives a new dimension in creating the illusion with the colourful fire.
