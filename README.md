# colour-changing-fire-led-simulation
fire simulation using ws2812 led strips with "flame" colour changing effect is established.

This program is originally taken from https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/Fire2012 page and modified for my project.
I have mainly modified the color scheme in order to get slowing blending of colour of the fire effect. The belnding effect was rather smooth. For my project, I installed leds inside a rather small foam hose and therefore I only used small number of leds (7), so I had to adapt other parameters in the code. Even with such small number the result was quite impressive. Modifying the colour scheme gives a new dimension in creating the illusion with the colourful fire.
